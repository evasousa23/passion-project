            <h3>Why Viana do Castelo?</h3>
            <h2>Northernmost city in Portugal</h2>
            <p>
              Viana do Castelo is one of the most beautiful cities in northern
              Portugal. Its participation in the Portuguese Discoveries and,
              later, in cod fishing show its traditional connection to the sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Viana - also known for its gold filigree - has managed to maintain
              its traditions, as you can see in the Costume Museum (costume and
              gold), the Municipal Museum (especially the typical Viana crockery
              on display here) and the Gil Eanes ship. Built in the Viana do
              Castelo shipyards to support the cod fishing industry, the ship is
              now moored here as a reminder of the city's maritime and
              shipbuilding traditions.

                <h4>Santuário de Santa Luzia</h4>
                <p>
                  At the top of the hill that frames Viana do Castelo stands the
                  Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Visible from
                  kilometres away, as if welcoming those who enter the city, the
                  temple crowns the Princess of Lima. Those who choose to climb
                  the hill receive a breathtaking panorama in return, where the
                  bucolic and verdant valley merges with the modernity and
                  urbanity of the city, all accompanied by the Lima River
                  flowing into the Atlantic, where we can almost still see the
                  Caravels that once set sail for the Discoveries - all in one
                  place, all in one view.

                <h4>The Gil Eannes Ship (Gil EannesHospital Ship)</h4>
                <p>
                  The Gil Eannes Hospital Ship, built in Viana do Castelo in
                  1955, for decades supported the Portuguese cod fishing fleet
                  that operated on the banks of Newfoundland and Greenland. It
                  has been converted into a Museological Unit and Sea Centre,
                  giving its visitors a truly remarkable experience. Today it is
                  a focal visitor attraction in Viana do Castelo.
